# Upgrade OpenRig

An upgrade is an observed agent workflow, not a transaction hidden behind one
command. Hosts differ, process state drifts, local plugin files accumulate, and
the useful response to a failed step depends on what is still alive.

**The agent owns the sequence. Stop after every mutation and observe the actual
effect before choosing the next step.** There is deliberately no end-to-end
upgrade subcommand.

## Safety model

Keep these planes separate:

- Seats normally live in tmux and can survive a daemon restart.
- The daemon, database, wrappers, and managed plugin projection are the control
  plane being changed.
- `rig down` tears down seats. It is not part of a continuity-preserving upgrade.

Before acting, name the rigs and seats whose continuity matters. On a production
host, use the host's normal operator ceremony. On a recovery-friendly build VM,
the orchestrator may adopt a tested runtime directly, but still observes each
step and stops on unexplained drift.

## When recovery crosses an instance boundary

Before either lane changes runtime state, record one host-qualified executor and
explicitly select the queue store that owns the recovery ruling. State whether
the original owner continues, waits, or transfers; an open obligation in another
store is not exclusive custody of this ruling. If the original store is down,
retain its owner's disposition in the surviving ruling and communicate it to
that owner before a competing executor acts.

A refused claim means reconcile ownership with the ruling owner before any
further runtime action; it does not authorize continuing under a separate older
row. A return names the full executor address and deliberately selected store.
Read the resulting row there, including source, destination, body, and the
original owner's disposition, before resuming. Receipt creation alone does not
establish that a waiting lane received or accepted the transfer.

## The loop

For every step:

1. **Inspect.** Derive current facts from the live host.
2. **Decide.** Choose one bounded mutation and state its expected effect.
3. **Act once.** Do not bundle the next mutation with it.
4. **Observe.** Check the process, listener, database, plugin, and seat surfaces
   that the step could have changed.
5. **Continue, adapt, or stop.** A failed expectation is information for the
   agent, not permission for a blind retry.

## Bounded helpers

Let `SKILL_DIR` be the directory containing this `SKILL.md`. These scripts emit
JSON and do not decide the upgrade sequence.

### Inspect current facts

```bash
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/inspect-upgrade.mjs"
```

This asks the installed `rig` for its version, daemon status, node inventory,
and plugin inventory. A missing surface remains visible with a suggested next
probe. `ready: false` means the agent must resolve or consciously bound the gap;
it does not mean the script should mutate anything.

### Back up SQLite

Take continuity snapshots first:

```bash
rig snapshot <rig-id>
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/backup-sqlite.mjs" \
  --source "$OPENRIG_HOME/openrig.sqlite" \
  --destination "/safe/path/openrig-before-upgrade.sqlite"
```

The helper refuses to overwrite a destination, uses SQLite's backup operation,
and verifies the backup with `PRAGMA integrity_check`. It does not stop the
daemon or restore a database.

### Plan or apply safe managed-plugin refreshes

Plugin trees may contain skills as well as hooks and metadata. Compare the last
packaged ancestor, the target package, and the live installed tree:

```bash
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/refresh-managed-plugin.mjs" \
  --ancestor /path/to/previous/package/plugin \
  --target /path/to/target/package/plugin \
  --live "$OPENRIG_HOME/plugins/<plugin>"
```

Review the sorted decisions. To apply only `refresh-safe` and `add-safe` files:

```bash
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/refresh-managed-plugin.mjs" \
  --ancestor /path/to/previous/package/plugin \
  --target /path/to/target/package/plugin \
  --live "$OPENRIG_HOME/plugins/<plugin>" \
  --apply-safe
```

The helper never deletes a live file and never overwrites a local modification.
Local deletions, live-only files, target removals, and ambiguous types are
reported for the agent to resolve. Re-run the plan after any manual resolution.

### Migrate a pre-0.5.9 instance layout

Version 0.5.9 puts context-usage telemetry in
`$OPENRIG_HOME/state/context-usage`, provider telemetry in
`state/provider-usage`, the addressable library under `context/`, and the
default System World at `context/system/system-world.yaml`. Existing 0.5.8
homes cross that boundary through an **Agent-Operated Migration**: the target
runtime reads canonical-first with legacy-fallback while all new writes use the
canonical state roots. An explicitly configured custom context-library root
stays stable throughout activation.

The helper supplies bounded, inspectable operations. The agent owns their
sequence and the target-runtime activation between them. With an exact
protected preimage path, first inspect and then prepare canonical directories,
the default System World, and a config pin to the existing library. Preparation
does not copy telemetry, rewrite live collector settings, or run lifecycle
actions:

`--help` prints the phase grammar without inventorying the instance. With no
phase flag the helper intentionally runs the read-only plan; unknown options
fail nonzero before plan or mutation.

```bash
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/migrate-telemetry-state-0.5.9.mjs" --help

node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/migrate-telemetry-state-0.5.9.mjs" \
  --home "$OPENRIG_HOME"

node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/migrate-telemetry-state-0.5.9.mjs" \
  --home "$OPENRIG_HOME" \
  --apply-state \
  --preimage "$OPENRIG_HOME/backups/layout-0.5.9-before"
```

Activate the exact target runtime using the ordinary upgrade workflow. Then
wait until every bounded post-apply legacy tail is followed by newer paired
new-root samples for that same seat. This proves temporal convergence
without blanket process replacement; a later legacy write remains a hard stop.
Capture the verification JSON; copied old sidecars are not evidence:

```bash
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/migrate-telemetry-state-0.5.9.mjs" \
  --home "$OPENRIG_HOME" \
  --verify \
  --preimage "$OPENRIG_HOME/backups/layout-0.5.9-before" \
  > /safe/path/layout-0.5.9-verify.json
```

Only a successful receipt authorizes the separately invoked non-destructive
finalizer. It copies an unconfigured legacy library into the canonical root
without overwriting anything; a custom context-library root remains stable:

```bash
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/migrate-telemetry-state-0.5.9.mjs" \
  --home "$OPENRIG_HOME" \
  --apply-library \
  --preimage "$OPENRIG_HOME/backups/layout-0.5.9-before" \
  --verification /safe/path/layout-0.5.9-verify.json
```

Stop on every reported issue: malformed or foreign telemetry, a reserved-path
conflict, a library collision, config drift, resumed legacy writes, byte drift,
or a missing fresh dual sample all require the named repair before continuing.
Verification binds the exact accepted tail bytes to their paired-newer samples;
the finalizer revalidates them immediately before switching config. The helper
never removes the legacy telemetry or library. Their later retirement is a
separate agent decision after stable runtime, writer, reader, and recovery proof.
It does not stop/start the daemon, launch a seat, touch the database, or decide
whether the upgrade proceeds.

To recover, restore the prior runtime as the agent-led workflow requires, then
reverse only helper-owned config, System World, empty-directory, and copied
library effects. Real state samples and both legacy recovery sources remain for
inspection:

```bash
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/migrate-telemetry-state-0.5.9.mjs" \
  --home "$OPENRIG_HOME" \
  --rollback "$OPENRIG_HOME/backups/layout-0.5.9-before"
```

## Agent-led continuity upgrade

This is a decision guide, not a command recipe. Adapt paths and checks to the
host in front of you.

1. Inspect the current CLI, daemon, nodes, and plugins with the helper.
2. Checkpoint active work and record the exact protected tmux/session census.
3. Run `rig snapshot <rig-id>` for each protected rig.
4. Create and verify the SQLite backup.
5. Build or stage the target runtime separately. Prove its version and source
   identity before touching the live daemon.
6. Run `rig daemon stop`. Verify both the listener and the identified daemon
   process are gone. If the command returns while either remains, stop: inspect
   identity and use the host's authorized recovery procedure. Do not blindly
   signal a PID.
7. Start the target with `rig daemon start` or the host's known wrapper. Verify
   daemon status, process path, listener, version, and database integrity.
8. Run the plugin refresh helper in plan mode. Apply safe writes only after the
   three roots and classifications make sense; resolve preserved paths one at a
   time when required.
9. Verify protected seats with `rig ps --nodes -A --json`, representative
   `rig capture`, and `rig restore-check` where applicable. `-A` is required:
   without it the node read is your CURRENT rig only, and a daemon upgrade
   protects seats across every rig on the host — so the narrow form reports
   success while seats outside your rig went unchecked.
10. Align wrappers only after deriving how that host owns them. Use its existing
    mechanism; this skill does not rewrite launchers.
11. Record the observed result, remaining local preservation decisions, and the
    exact rollback runtime and backup.

## Stop and hand back when

- a protected tmux session is missing before the upgrade;
- database integrity or backup verification fails;
- the running process or listener does not match the expected runtime;
- daemon stop reports success but the identified process or listener remains;
- the target cannot start against the existing database;
- plugin roots cannot be tied to a known ancestor and target;
- a required plugin path is classified as locally modified or deleted and the
  correct ownership decision is unclear;
- continuing would require `rig down`, destructive restore, credential changes,
  or broader authority than the operator has.

When stopping, report the last proven-good state, the first failed expectation,
the exact evidence, and the smallest decision needed from the owner. Preserve
live seats and the database unless recovery specifically requires otherwise.

## Rollback is also agent-led

Prefer starting the previous known runtime against the still-valid database.
Restore the database backup only when a migration or corruption finding requires
it; a degraded projection alone is not proof that the database should be
replaced. After rollback, repeat the same process, listener, database, plugin,
and seat observations used during the forward path.
